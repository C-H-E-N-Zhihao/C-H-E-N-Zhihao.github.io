Final-year BSc student in Artificial Intelligence with hands-on research experience at EPFL BioRob and top AI labs. My research focuses on the intersection of **representation learning**, **multi-modal LLMs**, and **continual learning**. 

I am deeply interested in emergent intelligence and developing world models that unify perception, action, and imagination in dynamic environments. I aim to advance this field by building scalable, reproducible pipelines that bridge foundational theory with real-time embodied AI.

**I am currently looking for a summer research program and plan to pursue Master studies in Fall 2026.**

Currently, I'm an Undergraduate Researcher at [IRI - UPC](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) working on future action prediction with state-space architectures.
